    "# JEOPARDY - EXPLORING DATA FOR THE EDGE TO WIN\n",
    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "This project would focus on the popular culture game of Jeopardy. The aim is to explore data and identify trends or insight that would allow us better prepare or prepare strategically to win the game. For this purpose, we would be using sample data that covers the first 20000 questions of aired episodes, from the [full data set](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/comments/1uyd0t/200000_jeopardy_questions_in_a_json_file/). We would like to answer the following questions:\n",
    "* How often the answer is deducible from the question?\n",
    "* How often new questions are repeats of older questions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's import the data and get familiar with it through some general EDA."
